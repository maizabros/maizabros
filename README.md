# Hi, I'm Adrian ðŸ‘‹

**AI Engineer | Researcher | Full-Stack Developer**

I'm an AI Engineer with over 1.5 years of experience, specializing in generative AI and deep learning. I co-authored an academic paper for IEEE WCCI 2024 and have hands-on experience developing cutting-edge solutions with Diffusion and Transformer models. I also have experience applying machine learning to industrial robotics, and previously contributed as a full-stack developer to judicial software.

Currently based in Tokyo, where I'm advancing my Japanese language skills (approximately N3 level), I am passionate about driving innovation through research and development. I love to explore how generative models can shape the future of AI, and my recent projects involve working with Stable Diffusion, GANs, and beyond!
